As an architecture, I applied the MVVM with coordinator pattern, along with the Clean Architecture approach. 
With Clean Architecture, I completely separated the layers (such as Presentation, Domain, and Data) from each other. 
The MVVM pattern was chosen for its simplicity, testability, ease of use, and widespread adoption in iOS development. This makes it easier for newcomers to onboard.

To improve testability and prepare for modularization, a simple DI container was also implemented.

For the search algorithm, a binary search was used, as it is one of the most efficient search algorithms. In addition, a sort was performed on the initial list of items.

Async/await was used for the data parser mechanism to move the logic out of the main thread. 

(TODO) To further speed up the parser algorithm, I plan to split the JSON file into multiple chunks and run parsing and sorting in parallel. 
Then, I will merge all the results into a single collection.
